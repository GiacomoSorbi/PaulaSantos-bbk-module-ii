      <h2>Animated GIF - Ice cream</h2>
      <p>
        The GIF below was produced by importing an MP4 into Photoshop and
        converting video frames to layers. A frame animation was created in the
        Timeline, and of the 200+ layers only 30 were selected. Of those 30 the
        last 15 were reversed to make the GIF less repetitive and more dynamic.
        The GIF was exported for the web and optimised so that it didn't lose
        quality when published.
      </p>
      <p>The GIF can be used in a social media campaign as follows:</p>

      <h3>Edited version</h3>
      <p>
        The original layer in the image below was duplicated in Photoshop, and
        the copy in the foreground was made smaller, for the back layer to act
        as a frame. The levels were adjusted in the background layer so that it
        was darker, intensifying the frame effect. The color balance was
        adjusted in the foreground layer to intensify the colours. The image was
        exported for the web as a progressive high quality JPG.

      <h3>Edited version</h3>
      <p>
        The orginal vector image was edited as an Illustrator file designed by
        <a href="http://www.freepik.com">Freepik</a> that was exported for the
        web as a PNG-24. The saucepan vector was isolated in the orginal
        Illustrator file, rotated and the colour modified. It was then exported
        for the web as a PNG-24 which was then converted as the site's favicon.
